-- Exporting (Guessing you exported the disc already) --

1) Open quickbms.exe (may need administrator for win 11)

2) First window asks for script, select the Pipeworks Bundle Files v3 file provided in the same folder.

3) Asks for input. It wants a bdg file thats was extracted, choose the one you want.

4) Asks for output. Where do you want the files to be extracted?

5) Once the files are extracted (press enter when it stops), you can have access to:

(examples) AI from common.bdg, Character Data from the <Kaiju>.bdg, and Stage files.

-- Reimporting into a BDG --

1) With BDG files extracted, DELETE ANY YOU DO NOT PLAN TO EDIT!

2) Once you edited the files (through HxD probably) open reimport from the QuickBMS Folder.

3) Pick the Pipeworks Bundle Files v3 Script in the same folder like usual for the bms script.

4) Input this time wants the BDG you extracted the files from.
(For example ill say MonsterAI and common.bdg)

5) Output for example will be the edited MonsterAI file.

6) With the script being the pipeworks folder, input common.bdg, and output as Monster AI: The File will be reimported into common.bdg (example)!

Notes: Keep the filesize the same. When hex editing the last byte cannot move from where it is located. But you may relocate values elsewhere here is an example:

If there is a value like 0.000010000 or something, you may delete a zero and place a new byte elsewhere. It will be the same size but will allow you to do stuff like setting a particle's color to 0.1 instead of 1 by doing "2E 31" instead of just 31.
