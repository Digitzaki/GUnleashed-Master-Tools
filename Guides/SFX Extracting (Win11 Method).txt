-- Extracting Audio (not music, Character sounds) --

For windows 11 may need to run in command prompt. Commands for it included.

1) Take the .UBER and .samp of chosen audio files. (Audio from GU and Revolution included)

2) Drag the uber over uber-extract.py, Command prompt method: Open the sfx tools folder in terminal: and run "python uber-extract.py <charactername>.uber". You will now have an .sdir file as one of the extraction (it needs the samp in order to work).

3) Drag the .sdir over wiimusyx-extract.py or run in terminal (same method): 
   "python wiimusyx-extract.py <charactername>.sdir" all sound files will get extracted.
