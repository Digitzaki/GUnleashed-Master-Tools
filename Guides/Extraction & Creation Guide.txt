--- Extraction Dolphin Method ---

1) Open Dolphin and right click on your Godzilla Unleashed iso/rvz. Does not matter if it is GUO/GUOR/FW.

2) Open the properties tab and go to the far right tab named Filesystem.

3) The disc at the very top right click and hit "Extract Entire Disc".

4) Extract to anywhere on your computer.

5) You now have all GU files extracted inside a folder!

--- Extraction WIT Method ---


1) Download Wit (Wiimms ISO Tool) at: https://wit.wiimm.de

2) Once installed find your Unleashed folder location

3) Right click where the disc is located (not the actual disc folder) and click "Open Terminal". If not you can copy the directory file path, open command prompt and type "cd <paste file path here>".

3) Type in "wit extract <filename goes here>.iso"

4) Wit will extract the iso to a Folder for you.

--- Reimport/Compression of Extracted Disc ---

!! If you just want to test your edited files, hit Open inside dolphin, find your extracted Unleashed and open Game/Sys/main.dol. The game will run. !!

1) WIT is reccomended as its by far the easiest way I've found.

2) With WIT installed open the directory where your extracted disc is again (not the disc folder itself)

3) Right click and open Terminal

4) type in "wit copy <extracted folder name goes here> <name goes here>.iso". if you did "wit copy <foldername> godilla.iso" it will create a runnable GU iso under "godilla.iso".

5) If you want this iso compressed have it show up in dolphin, Right click it, and convert to an RVZ.
