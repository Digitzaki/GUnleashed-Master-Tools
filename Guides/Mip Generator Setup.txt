Requires python & pillow module: with python "pip install Pillow" in terminal. (may need to reopen editor)

Used on Visual Studio Code, doesn't like working through Command Prompt. Should be able to run on Pycharm and etc.

Right click your input and output folder, copy path and paste them in the code for the values input_folder and output_folder. keep them between the ''

Once that is done put the pngs in the input folder, run the file, and mip_maps will be created up to
mip_3, each mip is 50% smaller.
