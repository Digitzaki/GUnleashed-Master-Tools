Pipeworks Particle Editor
Developed by: Akira Ryuzaki (Digitzaki)

Description:

PWKs Particle Editor is an application that allows you to adjust color properties for your particle/beam effects. With sliders outputting instant feedback, you can easily create the perfect colors for your project.

Features:

Color Sliders: Pipeworks Particle Editor provides three sliders for Red, Green, and Blue color channels, allowing you to adjust color values with precision up to two decimal places.

Hex Color Output: These sliders instantly generate the correct hex editor values, making it easy to copy them into your project for color customization. An Unsigned Hex value output is also included.

Red: LO=KA? (e.g. 2E 32 (.2))
Green: LP=KA? (e.g. 2E 33 38 (.38))
Blue: LQ=KA? (e.g. 2E 36 32 (.62))
Unsigned Hex Value: Color Hex (e.g. 40 E0 D0 (Turquoise))

Alpha Slider: Pipeworks Particle Editor includes an Alpha slider (LR=KA?) that lets you control more transparency of your colors. The slider ranges from 1 to 5. (3 is Reccomended)

Transparency Control: The closer the color values are to 0, the more transparent the color becomes, allowing you to achieve the desired level of transparency for your particle effects.
(Intended as this is what particles did with lower color values in Unleashed)

How to Use:

1) Launch the Pipeworks Particle Editor application.
2) Use the Red, Green, and Blue sliders to adjust the color values.
3) Observe the corresponding hexadecimal values for Red, Green, and Blue.
4) Use the Alpha slider to control the transparency of your colors further.
5) Experiment with the sliders to achieve the desired color and transparency for your particle effects.
6) Copy the generated hex values and apply them in your exported particle file.

Disclaimers:

Alpha slider multiplies the Transparency by 25%, the real amount LR=KA? controls is unknown.
Results may slightly vary.
